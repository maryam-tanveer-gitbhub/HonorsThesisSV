# HonorsThesisSV
Here is the code used to compile and analyze survey data on my honors thesis. 
In this project, I had two main phases of cleaning. The first phase's purpose was to code survey results, scoring results.
The second phase took away columns and rows that were extraneous. 
I used Python and R to complete data cleaning and employed SPSS to analyze.
